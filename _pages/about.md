I received my Bachelor's degree in Informaton Engineering in June, 2023 from [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/), City University of Hong Kong. I'm generally intersted in ML/DL Theory and non-convex optimization. 

Currently I'm a research assistant at City University of Hong Kong supervised by [Dr. Chen Liu](https://liuchen1993.cn/HomePage/index.html) where I'm investigating the reason behind the superior performance of adaptive methods (e.g., Adam) in language models. I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Rosa CHAN](https://cityucompuneurolab.github.io/rosa.html) who patiently guided me to start my research adventure. I also had a great time at University of Michigan, working with [Dr. Samet Oymak](https://intra.ece.ucr.edu/~oymak/index.html) on the theoretical foundations of self-attention.
