I'm Yixiao HUANG (Chinese name: 黄一笑). I received my Bachelor's degree in Informaton Engineering in June, 2023 from [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/), City University of Hong Kong. I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Rosa CHAN](https://cityucompuneurolab.github.io/rosa.html) who patiently guided me to start my research adventure. Currently I'm a research intern at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor under the supervision of [Dr. Samet Oymak](https://intra.ece.ucr.edu/~oymak/index.html), where I'm investigating the **implicit bias of transformers**. I'm also interested in the theory side of **adversarial robustness and generalization property**.
